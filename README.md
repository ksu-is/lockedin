# Locked In
A simple program that a student or someone working would use to adapt to time management problems and complete tasks at hand distraction free.
## Purpose
The use for this application is for people that have attention issues or ADD/ ADHD and the use of this program is so that people have a good tempo when working in order to not get overwhelmed and stressed out when completing a task. 
## Inspiration of Project
The obvious inspiration for this project is my attention span and how easy it is for me to get stressed out when needed to complete a handful of assignments. An application like this would help with stress and also keep the focus on the work at hand.
